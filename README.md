# Oogway

Oogway is a simple web server with dynamic content generation and extendability in mind supporting a Git based workflow. It's somewhere in between a static site generator and building a website manually. Sites are rendered using Go templates and the content can be automatically updated from a Git repository or placed manually inside the `content` directory, allowing you to test changes locally before committing. Oogway can be used as a library in your Go application to add template functions and other behaviour.

Oogway is for you if you:

* like to write code
* need more than just static content
* don't want to fiddle on your server too much

**Oogway is still work in progress!**

* in-template markdown support
* sync with GitHub repo (selected branch or master by default)
* example website
* documentation
